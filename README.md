# Elevator-Monitoring-System
An arduino based elevator monitoring prototype
The system functions as follows:
1. A person requests for the elevator by pressing the request pushbutton.
2. When the elevator detects a passenger at the entry, it opens the doors, increases the count, and then shuts. Then the passenger enters the floor to stop at using any of the three pushbuttons.
3. The elevator will then come to a stop at the desired floor, open its doors, and count down when a passenger exits the elevator.
4. Then step 2 will repeat.
5. The LCD shows a notice when the elevator's capacity is exceeded and the elevator remains stationary.
6. The PC is used to upload the system program to the microcontroller.
